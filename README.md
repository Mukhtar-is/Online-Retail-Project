# Online-Retail-Project
In this project, I'll be working with transactional data from an online retail store. The dataset contains information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. I'll explore and analyze this dataset to gain insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products.

### Project scenario

An online retail company is looking to interpret its data to help make key business decisions. They want you to use exploratory data analysis on their transactional data, which contains information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. Your task is to explore and analyze this dataset to gain insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products, in order to help drive business decisions.

### Summary
This project is transactional data from an online retail store. By conducting EDA, I will identify patterns, outliers, and correlations in the data, to make data-driven decisions and recommendations. Some of the main project objectives include:

- Describe data to answer key questions to uncover insights
- Gain valuable insights that will help improve online retail performance
- Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations

#### Dataset
The dataset you will be working with is the "Online Retail" dataset. It contains transactional data of an online retail store from 2010 to 2011. The dataset is available as a .xlsx file named Online Retail.xlsx. This data file is already included in the Coursera Jupyter Notebook environment, however if you are working off-platform it can also be downloaded here.
The dataset contains the following columns:

- InvoiceNo: Invoice number of the transaction
- StockCode: Unique code of the product
- Description: Description of the product
- Quantity: Quantity of the product in the transaction
- InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction
- UnitPrice: Unit price of the product
- CustomerID: Unique identifier of the customer
- Country: Country where the transaction occurred

### Solution
As the main objective of this Online Retail Project is to interpret real-world data to make a key business decision, I proceeded with data cleaning and validation, addressing missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency. This process significantly improved data quality and reliability, leading to insightful visualizations that highlighted key findings include actionable insights derived from EDA informed strategic decisions.

### Approach
In my online retail project, I began by installing and loading essential Python packages such as matplotlib, pandas, numpy, and seaborn to facilitate data analysis and visualization. then I imported the datasets using pandas and proceeded with data cleaning and validation, addressing missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we utilized pandas and seaborn to generate descriptive statistics and visualizations, uncovering patterns, trends, and anomalies. This process significantly improved data quality and reliability, leading to insightful visualizations that highlighted key findings. The actionable insights derived from EDA informed strategic decisions, ultimately enhancing data-driven decision-making and contributing to better business outcomes.





### Conclusion 
my online retail project demonstrated the power of data analytics and visualization in driving business success. By installing and utilizing essential Python packages, cleaning and validating data, and conducting thorough exploratory data analysis, I able to uncover valuable insights that informed strategic decisions. This comprehensive approach not only improved operational efficiency and customer satisfaction but also positioned the business for sustained growth and success in the competitive online retail market.
