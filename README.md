# Online-Retail-Project
In this project, I'll be working with transactional data from an online retail store. The dataset contains information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. I'll explore and analyze this dataset to gain insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products.
